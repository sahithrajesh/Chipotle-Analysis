# Chipotle Macroeconomic Analysis
This project was done as the capstone project for the CS 2316 - Data Input/Manipulation course. It analyzes the impact of macroeconmic factors like GDP, unemployment rate, inflation, etc on Chipotle's performance from 2015-2025. It seeks to understand how the economic health of the countries Chipotle operates in influences Chipotle's revenue, net income, and stock price. The analysis combines data from the IMF, scraped data from Eulerpool, and stock price data from Alpha Vantage API. The core goal was to quantify the relationship between the economy and Chipotle's profitabiltiy.
